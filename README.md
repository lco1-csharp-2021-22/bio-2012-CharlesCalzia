# Question 2

Ahead of next week's BIO (even if you're not doing it, answering questions is good practice) please attempt question 2 (feel free to do 1 and 3 if you're finished) from [2012](https://olympiad.org.uk/papers/2012/bio/round_one.html). 

Things to concentrate on: 
- input and output - taking in the values in the required form, while you are interacting with the user, you should be doing the work in functions 
- data structures - how are you storing the data, have you considered [tuples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples)? 
- testing - make sure it works for the example given, but then use the mark scheme to test your code (hint: `Debug.Assert` is useful here). 

And don't ignore the other parts to the question(s) - can your code address parts (b), (c) and (d)?
